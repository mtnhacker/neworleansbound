# Christmas in New Orleans

There is a lot to do at Christmas time in New Orleans.

1. Check out the **Christmas lights on St Charles Avenue.** All of the mansions on St. Charles are beautifully decorated. You can take the streetcar from 3rd Street to Carrolton and back to see them.
2. **Bonfires on the levee**. Start on River Road in Laplace and drive west through Reserve to Gramercy. Go before dusk to see the bonfire preparations. Fires are lit after dark.
3. **[Celebration in the Oaks](https://celebrationintheoaks.com/).** You can drive your car through City Park to see all of the decorated oak trees. You can also buy a ticket to walk through the botanical gardens and ride the carousel. 
4. **Christmas caroling in Jackson Square.** The Sunday before Christmas people gather in Jackson Square to sing Christmas carols. Volunteers hand out song books and candles. Caroling begins at 7pm.
5. **[Roosevelt Hotel lobby](https://www.therooseveltneworleans.com/).** Several of the hotels have beautiful decorations in the lobby. The Roosevelt always has a beautiful collection of Christmas trees. Walk through the lobby and stop and have a slow gin fizz or a sazerac at the Sazerac bar. (In the 1949 when women were first allowed to drink in bars in New Orleans, women "stormed" the Sazerac. There is a celebration every year.)
6. **[Reveillon dinners](https://holiday.neworleans.com/tradition/reveillon-dinners/).** During the month of December, many of the restaurants in New Orleans have special Christmas menus, called a Reveillon dinner, that consists of several dishes. It's in memory of the big meal families would eat after Christmas Eve mass. Recommendations are recommended!
